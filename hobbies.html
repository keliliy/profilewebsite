             I have been learning for 10 years, and<br> started playing when I was 5  years  old. <br> Around 1 year ago I finished my grade<br> 8 exam, getting a result of Merit. Currently <br>I am working towards the ABRSM <br> performance diploma, and my favourite <br> piece I'm learning right now for that is <br> a song named "Brahms
            - Ballade in g minor <br>op. 118 no.3"

            One of my favourite series is " A good<br> girls guide to murder", which is a mystery <br>book that follows a girl named pip solving <br>a murder. My favourite genres are fantasy,<br>romance, and mystery. I love books that are <br>written well, and have a unique premise and plot.

            I love playing Roblox and play almost at <br>least once a week. It's a great platform for<br> me to go on whenever I'm bored, since <br> there are lots of different types of games.<br> I also enjoy other games such as uno, gartic <br> phone, slap, banana split, board games, card <br>games, etc.
